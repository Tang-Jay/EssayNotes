**一些举例**

- 对每一篇文献详细分析

Biel et al. [17] studied personality impressions in conversational videos (vlogs) from facial expression analysis (目的). 
In their work, a subset of the Youtube vlog dataset [57] is adopted, as well as a facial expression model based on Facial Action Coding System (FACS) (方法).
The task of first impressions prediction is addressed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) combined with statistics of facial activity based on frame-by-frame estimates (细节1).
Moreover, they analyzed what specific facial expressions are most prominent for modeling each of the different impressions (细节2) .
Results show that extraversion is the trait showing the largest activity cue utilization, which is related to the evidence found in the literature that extraversion is typically easier to judge [58], [59] (结果).
Later, Aran and Gatica-Perez [60] studied the use of social media content as a domain to learn apparent personality traits, in particular extraversion, aiming to transfer the knowledge extracted from conversational videos to small group settings (目的).
Ridge Regression and SVM classifiers are combined with statistics extracted from weighted Motion Energy Images for the task of personality impressions prediction (方法/细节).

- 对文献进行方法分类

In low-level vision and computer graphics, for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)(目的), 
the widely used Multigrid method [3] reformulates the system as subproblems at multiple scales,
where each subproblem is responsible for the residual solution between a coarser and a finer scale(方法/细节).
 An alternative to Multigrid is hierarchical basis pre-conditioning [44, 45], which relies
on variables that represent residual vectors between two scales(方法/细节). It has been shown [3, 44, 45] that these solvers converge much faster than standard solvers that are unaware of the residual nature of the solutions (结果结论). These methods suggest that a good reformulation or
preconditioning can simplify the optimization.

- 对文献进行时序分类

Practices and theories that lead to shortcut connections [2, 33, 48] have been studied for a long time(目的).
 An early practice of training multi-laver perceptrons (MLPs) (方法名称) is to add a
linear layer connected from the network input to thy, output [33, 48] (方法细节). In [43, 24], a few
intermediate layers are directly connected to auxiliary classifiers for addressing vanishing/exploding
gradients. (方法细节) The papers of [38, 37, 31, 46] propose methods for centering layer reponses,
gradients, and propagated errors, implemented by shortcut connections. In [43], an inception" layer
is com-posed of a shortcut branch and a few deeper branches. (方法细节)

**3. 整理成段**

To deal with the exploding gradient problem during the training as well as enhancing the performance of deep models. He et al. [1] proposed a deep residual network, where the shortcut connections perform identity mapping, and their outputs are added to the
outputs of the stacked layers. The results showed that this model obtained the state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and competitions.
